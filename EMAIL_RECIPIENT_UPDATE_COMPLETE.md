# Email Recipient Configuration Update - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully updated all email tasks to send to: **mehakakram089@gmail.com**

## Changes Made

### 1. Task Files Updated (3 files)
All email tasks in `Needs_Action/` now use the correct recipient:

**File: Needs_Action/20260215-test-002-email.md**
```markdown
**Recipients**: mehakakram089@gmail.com
```

**File: Needs_Action/task-001-send-weekly-report.md**
```markdown
**To:** mehakakram089@gmail.com
```

**File: Needs_Action/task-003-q1-stakeholder-update.md**
```markdown
- To: mehakakram089@gmail.com
```

### 2. Code Fixed (1 file)
**File: reasoning_loop/plan_generator.py**

Updated email extraction regex to handle multiple markdown formats:
- `- To: email@example.com`
- `**To:** email@example.com`
- `**Recipients**: email@example.com`

**Lines Changed:**
- Line 202: Updated regex in `_generate_steps()` method
- Line 282: Updated regex in `_generate_action_preview()` method

**New Regex Pattern:**
```python
email_match = re.search(r'\*?\*?(?:to|recipients?)\*?\*?:\s*\*?\*?\s*(\S+@\S+)', content, re.IGNORECASE)
```

## Verification Results

✅ All 3 email tasks now show correct recipient in plan previews:
```
- To: mehakakram089@gmail.com (task-001)
- To: mehakakram089@gmail.com (task-003)
- To: mehakakram089@gmail.com (20260215-test-002)
```

✅ Plan executor reads from original task files (already correct)
✅ MCP server accepts any recipient (no changes needed)
✅ Architecture unchanged (task-level configuration only)

## Testing

Run the reasoning loop to verify:
```bash
cd /e/AI_Employee_Vault
python reasoning_loop/main.py
```

Expected behavior:
1. Plans generated with correct recipient in preview
2. Plans routed to Pending_Approval/
3. After approval, emails sent to mehakakram089@gmail.com

## Future Email Tasks

Use this format for new email tasks:

```markdown
---
id: task-xxx
title: Your Task Title
priority: P1
source: manual
status: needs_action
tags: [email]
---

# Task: Your Task Title

Task description here.

**Email Details:**
- To: mehakakram089@gmail.com
- Subject: Your Subject
- Body:

Your email body content here.
```

## Architecture Notes

- ✅ No changes to MCP Server
- ✅ No changes to Email Handler
- ✅ No changes to Plan Executor
- ✅ No changes to Reasoning Loop
- ✅ Only updated: Task files + Plan Generator regex

The system reads email recipients from task files, so this is a clean, maintainable solution.

## Completion Status

🎉 **ALL EMAIL TASKS NOW SEND TO: mehakakram089@gmail.com**

System is ready for Silver Tier testing and production use.
