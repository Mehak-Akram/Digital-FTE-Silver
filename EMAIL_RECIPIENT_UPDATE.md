## Architecture Impact

### ✅ No Changes Required:
- **MCP Server** (`mcp_server/server.py`) - Tool signature unchanged
- **Email Handler** (`mcp_server/email_handler.py`) - Accepts any recipient
- **Plan Executor** (`reasoning_loop/plan_executor.py`) - Reads from task files
- **Plan Generator** (`reasoning_loop/plan_generator.py`) - No hardcoded emails
- **Reasoning Loop** (`reasoning_loop/main.py`) - Architecture unchanged

### 📝 Configuration Method:
The system reads email recipients directly from task files, so updating the task files is sufficient. No code changes needed.

## How It Works

1. **Task Creation**: User creates task file with email details
2. **Plan Generation**: Plan generator detects send_email action
3. **Plan Routing**: Routes to Pending_Approval for human review
4. **Approval**: Human approves the plan
5. **Execution**: Plan executor reads original task file and extracts email parameters
6. **MCP Call**: Sends email to the recipient specified in task file

## Future Email Tasks

To create new email tasks, use this format:

```markdown
---
id: task-xxx
title: Your Task Title
priority: P1
source: manual
status: needs_action
tags: [email]
---

# Task: Your Task Title

Send email description here.

**Email Details:**
- To: mehakakram089@gmail.com
- Subject: Your Subject
- Body:

Your email body content here.
```

## Verification

Run the reasoning loop to test:
```bash
python reasoning_loop/main.py
```

All email tasks will now send to: mehakakram089@gmail.com

## Notes

- Email configuration in `.env` remains unchanged (SMTP settings)
- MCP tool accepts any recipient address
- This is a task-level configuration, not a system-level restriction
- To change recipients in the future, simply edit the task files
